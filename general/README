This directory includes the following files:

compatibility_utilities.ecl:
compatibility_utilities.pl:
        Predicates that hide some incompatibilities between Eclipse and
        Sicstus.

dlist.pl:
        Basic operations on difference lists.

goal_table_in_tree.pl:
        A data structure for keeping Prolog goals, implemented as an open
        tree of open lists.

goal_table_simple.pl:
        A data structure for keeping Prolog goals, implemented as an open
        list.

otree.pl:
        Basic operations on open trees.

higher_order.pl:
        A few predicates for higher order operations (simulating some basic
        operations known from functional programming).

olist.pl:
        Basic operations on open lists.

open_set_in_tree.pl:
        Simple operations on open sets, used by utilities.

set_in_list.pl:
        Simple operations on smallish sets, used by utilities.

top_level.ecl:
        A simple top level (i.e., code that reads and stores programs,
        executes queries etc.).  It is loaded automatically by those
        metainterpreters that need it.  Eclipse-specific code.

top_level.pl:
        Ditto, converted to Sicstus Prolog.

utilities.pl:
        A set of useful predicates, loaded and called by the other programs.
