This directory includes the following files:

higher_order.pl:
        A few predicates for "higher order" operations (simulating some basic
        operations known from functional programming).

open_list.pl:
        Basic operations on "open lists".  (An open list is one whose final
        element is a variable. One can add new elements at the end without
        copying the list: the downside is that it is a destructive operation,
        i.e., the old list "disappears".)

sets.ecl:
        Simple operations on sets, used by utilities.ecl.

sets.pl:
        Ditto, converted to Sicstus Prolog.

top_level.ecl:
        A simple top level (i.e., code that reads and stores programs,
        executes queries etc.).  It is loaded automatically by those
        metainterpreters that need it.  Eclipse-specific code.

top_level.pl:
        Ditto, converted to Sicstus Prolog.

utilities.ecl:
        A set of useful predicates, loaded and called by the other programs.
        Eclipse-specific code.

utilities.pl:
        Ditto, converted to Sicstus Prolog.
