This directory includes the following files:

eager_tabling.ecl:
        A metainterpreter for tabled logic programs that applies a
        top-down, "eager tabling" strategy.  Neither the query nor the
        tabled answers need be ground, but when a query is executed, the
        interpreter tries to table as many solutions (both to the goal
        and to its descendants) as it can before it succeeds with the
        first solution.

        Just load it into Eclipse!  The head comment explains how to use
        it.

        NOTE: Don't use this version if the tabled program is also
              coinductive (and has been translated into Prolog by
              ../coind/translate_colp)! Eclipse is currently not good at
              handling cyclic terms, so use the Sicstus version instead.

colp.pl:
        Ditto converted to Sicstus.

examples:
        Some examples of tabled programs, all with the extension
        ".tlp".
        See also "../mixed/examples/LTL".
