This directory includes the following files:

dra.ecl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for Eclipse.

dra.pl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for Sicstus.

dra_builtins.pl:
        This file contains declarations of built-in predicates that are
        allowed by the "dra" interpreter.  Support for many new predicates
        can be obtained simply by extending the table, but some may require
        special support from the interpreter.  In particular, addition of the
        cut would be non-trivial (and probably ill-advised).

dra_common.pl:
        The code for an interpreter that implements tabling by using "Dynamic
        Reordering of Alternatives".  This interpreter can handle programs
        that use not only tabling, but also co-logic programming (even when
        the same predicate is both coinductive and tabled).

        Just load 'dra' into Eclipse or Sicstus!  The head comment
        explains how to use it.

examples:
        Some examples of tabled programs, all with the extension
        ".tlp".
