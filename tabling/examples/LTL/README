NOTE: 1. Each of the examples in this directory has two versions:

           - A file whose name ends with ".tlp" is for direct execution in
             "dra" (i.e., "verifier.tlp" is used without translation).

           - A file whose name ends with ".pl" includes the translated
             version of the verifier (i.e., "verifier.pl").  The example can
             be executed directly in Prolog, but some queries may loop, and
             will have to be interrupted by the user.

      2. If you want to try the examples directly in your logic programming
          system (without tabling), then it's best to comment out the
          directive ":- tabled tverify_ / 3." in "verifier.pl".



..........................................................................

This directory includes the following files:

verifier.clp:
        A version of "verifier.tlp" (see below) that can be translated to
        "verifier.pl" by using "../../../coind/translate.colp".

verifier.tlp:
        A version of Gopal Gupta's elegant "interpreter for Linear Temporal
        Logic" (more specifically, a program that verifies whether a given
        LTL formula holds in a given state of a given automaton).

        The program contains both tabled and coinductive predicates
        (however, each predicate is either tabled or coinductive, not
        both). It can be executed in one of two ways as follows:

           1. Load a concrete example that includes the translated verifier
              (i.e., "verifier.pl") into an implementation of tabled logic
              programming (e.g., "dra"), and then issue queries relevant to
              the example.

              (The example would contain a definition of an automaton,
              possibly with some queries.  File inclusion is done with a
              directive:
                   :-[ 'verifier.pl' ].
              )

           2. Just load an example that includes 'verifier.tlp" into "dra".
              Since the "dra" interpreter also supports coinductive
              programming directly, the translation step can be omitted.

normalize.pl:
        Simple normalization of LTL expressions, used by
        "verifier.tlp".

errors.tlp:
        A version of "example3.tlp" into which a number of errors have been
        introduced to test the diagnostics of "verifier.tlp".

example.pl:
example.tlp:
        The definition of a simple automaton and some convenient LTL
        queries.

        For the ".tlp" version: just load the example into "dra" (by writing
            prog( example ).  and then type "q1.", "q2." etc. to that
            interpreter's top level.

example2.pl:
example2.tlp:
        A somewhat more complex example similar to "example.tlp".

example3.pl:
example3.tlp:
        A smaller example.

example4.pl:
example4.tlp:
        A small example that attempts to catch a possible error in treating
        conjunctions when one conjunct is true along one path, and the other
        along another.

small_example.pl:
small_example.tlp:
        An even smaller example, good for tracing while troubleshooting the
        tabling interpreter.

microwave.pl:
microwave.tlp:
        Another example in the same spirit.  This one is actually a
        (somewhat simplified) model of a microwave oven.
