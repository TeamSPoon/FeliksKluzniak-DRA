This directory includes the following files:

bad.tlp:
bad2.tlp:
        Examples that test some of the diagnostics of the tabling
        interpreter.

comment_example.tlp:
        The example described in the head comment of
        "../eager_tabling".

small_comment_example.tlp:
        A minimal example that demonstrates why tabled results must be annotated
        with the corresponding goals.

conditional.clp:
        A wholly uninteresting example, designed to test that
        "../eager_tabling" handles conditionals correctly.

graph:
        A simple example that demonstrates a left-recursive program for
        finding paths in a graph.

guo_gupta_2_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_3_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_4_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_4_2.tlp:
guo_gupta_6_1.tlp:
        Examples 2.1, 3.1 etc. from "Tabled Logic Programming with
        Dynamic Reordering of Alternatives" by Hai-Feng Guo and Gopal
        Gupta.

module.tlp:
        A wholly uninteresting example, designed to test that the
        predicate names in the interpreted program cannot conflict with
        the names of the predicates that implement "../eager_tabling".

paper_example.tlp:
        An example from "Linear Tabling Strategies and Optimizations" by
        Neng-Fa Zhou, Taisuke Sato and Yi-Dong Shen.

parse.tlp:
        An example attributed to David S. Warren, taken from from
        "Linear Tabling Strategies and Optimizations" by Neng-Fa Zhou,
        Taisuke Sato and Yi-Dong Shen.

trivial_not_tabled.tlp:
        A trivial example in pure Prolog, a "smoke-test" for the interpreter.

trivial_tabled.tlp:
        A trivial example in Prolog with tabling, a "smoke-test" for the
        interpreter.

XSB:
        Various examples borrowed from the distribution of XSB.
