This directory includes the following files:

bad.tlp:
bad2.tlp:
bad3.tlp:
bad4.tlp:
bad5.tlp:
        Examples that test some of the diagnostics of the tabling
        interpreter.

comment_example.tlp:

        An example that demonstrates why tabled results must be annotated
        with the corresponding goals.

small_comment_example.tlp:
        A minimal example that demonstrates why tabled results must be
        annotated with the corresponding goals.

co_t.tlp:
        A very simple example of a predicate that is both tabled and
        coinductive.

conditional.tlp:
        A wholly uninteresting example, designed to test that the
        interpreter handles conditionals correctly.

graph.tlp:
        A simple example that demonstrates a left-recursive program for
        finding paths in a graph.

guo_gupta_2_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_3_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_4_1.tlp:
guo_gupta_4_2.tlp:
guo_gupta_6_1.tlp:
        Examples 2.1, 3.1 etc. from "Tabled Logic Programming with
        Dynamic Reordering of Alternatives" by Hai-Feng Guo and Gopal
        Gupta.

LTL:
        A subdirectory with a version of Gopal Gupta's elegant interpreter
        for Linear Temporal Logic and a few example problems and queries.

module.tlp:
        A wholly uninteresting example, designed to test that the
        predicate names in the interpreted program cannot conflict with
        the names of the predicates that implement the interpreter.

paper_example.tlp:
        An example from "Linear Tabling Strategies and Optimizations" by
        Neng-Fa Zhou, Taisuke Sato and Yi-Dong Shen.

parse.tlp:
        An example attributed to David S. Warren, taken from from
        "Linear Tabling Strategies and Optimizations" by Neng-Fa Zhou,
        Taisuke Sato and Yi-Dong Shen.

simple1.tlp:
simple2.tlp:
        Two artificial examples to exercise tabling interpreters.

trivial_not_tabled.tlp:
        A trivial example in pure Prolog, a "smoke-test" for the
        interpreter.

trivial_tabled.tlp:
        A trivial example in Prolog with tabling, a "smoke-test" for the
        interpreter.

XSB:
        A subdirectory with various examples borrowed from the distribution
        of XSB.  (http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~sbprolog/download_src.html)
