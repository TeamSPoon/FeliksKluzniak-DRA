 2 Apr 2009 :  Version 0.9 (beta).

29 Apr 2009:   Corrected two errors, added earlier detection of completion.

11 Apr 2009:   "New style" coinduction.

16 Apr 2009:   - "New style" coinduction should not be the default, so instead
                 of ":- coinductive." and ":- coinductive2." we now have
                 ":- coinductive1." and ":- coinductive.", respectively.
               - Corrected a major error in the choice of data structures.
