4 Feb 2009:  First "internal public" release.

             Known problems:
               - mixed/dra still not available;
               - tabling/eager_tabling has some minor problems in comments
                 as well as some unnecessary inefficiencies;
               - a very limited set of examples.

5 Feb 2009:  Second "internal public" release:

               Fixed:
                 - trace did not work in the Eclipse version of
                   "eager_tabling";
                 - removed one source of inefficiency (and disparity between
                   the code and the associated comment) in "eager_tabling".

6 Feb 2009:  Third "internal public" release:

               Fixed:
                 - In "eager_tabling" trace also internal events (e.g.,
                   adding a pioneer).
                 - The sanity-checking functions of the LTL interpreter
                   were unable to report an error when run in the tabling
                   interpreter.
                 - "translate_colp" had a spurious choice point which caused
                   a false error message if the user asked for more
                   solutions.
                 - Wrong permissions on many files.

13 Feb 2009:  Fourth "internal public" release:

                 - Added "dra".
                 - Deleted "eager_tabling", as superseded.
                 - Deleted "mixed", everything is now in "tabling".
                 - More small examples.

16 Feb 2009:   Fourth "internal public" release:

                 - Really deleted "eager_tabling" ;-).
                 - Found a couple of errors in "dra".
                 - "dra" checks consistency of declarations with definitions.
                 - "dra" gives priority to new answers (this can be changed by
                    using ":- old_first ...").
                 - The wallpaper trace is more informative.
