 2 Apr 2009 :  Version 0.9 (beta).

29 Apr 2009:   Corrected two errors, added earlier detection of completion.

11 Apr 2009:   "New style" coinduction.

16 Apr 2009:   - "New style" coinduction should not be the default, so
                 instead of ":- coinductive." and ":- coinductive2." we now
                 have ":- coinductive1." and ":- coinductive.", respectively.
               - Corrected a major error in the choice of data structures.

26 August 2009 (version 0.93 (beta)):
               - Various minor corrections, mostly cosmetic.
               - Making things acceptable to SWI Prolog:
                  1) Made the convention for partial application (as an
                     argument to apply/2) compatible with that of SWI Prolog,
                     which has apply/2 as a built-in.
                  2) Commented out mode declarations.
                  3) Renamed set_to_list/2 to list_from_set/2.
                  4) Some operators had to be put between parentheses.
                - Refactoring DRA files in order to facilitate porting to
                  SWI Prolog.
                - A version of DRA for SWI Prolog ("drap.pl").  The manual
                  was updated accordingly.
                - The process of porting to SWI Prolog uncovered an error in
                  DRA that did not manifest itself before only because both
                  Sicstus and Eclipse provide logical update semantics for
                  assert/1. The error is now fixed.
                - Addition of three examples by Brian W. DeVries. The
                  examples bring to light shortcomings of the current simple
                  LTL verifier.
