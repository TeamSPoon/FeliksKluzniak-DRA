This directory includes the following files:

colp.ecl:
        A metainterpreter of "co-logic programming".  Just load it into
        Eclipse!  The head comment explains how to use it.

translate_colp.ecl:
        A translator that converts "co-logic programming" programs into
        straightforward logic programs.  The head comment explains how
        to use it.

example.clp:
        This trivial file illustrates the use of file inclusion (works
        both with the metainterpreter and with the translator).  It
        includes another file that contains the real example.

examples:
        Some examples of coinductive programs, all with the extension
        ".clp".
        Files with translated programs will have the extension ".ecl".

original:
        A directory that contains a metainterpreter (and an example)
        almost exactly as they appeared in Luke Simon's Ph.D. thesis.
