This directory includes the following files:

colp.pl:
        A metainterpreter of "co-logic programming".  Just load it into
        Eclipse or Sicstus!  The head comment explains how to use it.

translate_colp.pl:
        A translator that converts "co-logic programming" programs into
        straightforward logic programs.  The head comment explains how
        to use it.

example.clp:
        This trivial file illustrates the use of file inclusion (works
        both with the metainterpreter and with the translator).  It
        includes another file that contains the real example.

examples:
        Some examples of coinductive programs, all with the extension
        ".clp".
        Files with translated programs will have the extension ".ecl" or
        ".pl", depending on whether the translation occurred wihin
        Eclipse or Sicstus.

original:
        A directory that contains a metainterpreter (and an example)
        almost exactly as they appeared in Luke Simon's Ph.D. thesis.
