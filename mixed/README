This directory includes the following files:

dra.ecl:
        An interpreter for tabled logic programs that applies a
        top-down, "eager tabling" strategy.  Neither the query nor the
        tabled answers need be ground, but when a query is executed, the
        interpreter tries to table as many solutions (both to the goal
        and to its descendants) as it can before it succeeds with the
        first solution.

        In principle the interpreter can also handle coinductive
        predicates, even when thay are also tabled.  (However, see the
        note below.)

        Just load it into Eclipse!  The head comment explains how to use
        it.

        NOTE: Don't use this version if the tabled program is also
              coinductive (and has been translated into Prolog by
              ../coind/translate_colp)! Eclipse is currently not good at
              handling cyclic terms, so use the Sicstus version instead.

dra.pl:
        Ditto converted to Sicstus.

examples:
        Some examples of tabled coinductive programs, all with the
        extension ".ctp".  There are also some simple Prolog files that
        contain support software.

        In particular, subdirectory LTL contains an extension of Gopal
        Gupta's elegant interpreter for Linear Temporal Logic and a few
        example problems and queries.
