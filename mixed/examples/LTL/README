NOTE:
      If you want to try the examples directly in your logic programming
      system (without a tabling interpreter), then you will have to
      comment out the directive ":- tabled tverify_ / 3." in
      interpreter.pl.

..........................................................................

This directory includes the following files:

interpreter.ctp:
        A version of Gopal Gupta's elegant interpreter for Linear
        Temporal Logic.

        The program contains both tabled and coinductive predicates
        (however, each predicate is either tabled or coinductive, not
        both). It can be executedd by loading a concrete example that
        includes it (via a ":-[interpreter]." directive) into the "dta"
        interpreter and then issuing queries relevant to the example.

        All these examples should also run with the "eager_tabling"
        interpreter (see directory "../../tabling"): the only difficulty
        is that one would have to specify the full file name, together
        with the extension.

normalize.pl:
        Simple normalization of LTL expressions, used by
        "interpreter.ctp".

errors.ctp:
        A version of "example3.ctp" into which a number of errors have been
        introduced to test the diagnostics of "interpreter.ctp".

example.ctp:
        The definition of a simple automaton and some convenient LTL
        queries.  Just load the example into "dra" and then type "q1.",
        "q2." etc. to that interpreter's top level.

example2.ctp:
        A somewhat more complex example similar to "example.ctp".

example3.ctp:
        A smaller example, good for tracing while troubleshooting the
        tabling interpreter.

microwave.ctp:
        Another example in the same spirit.  This one is actually a
        (somewhat simplified) model of a microwave oven.
